USYD ELEC1005 Project 2

## Description
A game where you control a train  :train: and try picking up people from the ground, and as you pick up more people the size of the train increases. The game ends if you crash into a wall or crash into yourself.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible, and keep collecting more people without crashing.

## How to Play
- Select the ‘Play!’ button on the loading screen to start the game, or quit to exit.
- The game map loads, and the train spawns facing towards the right with the head, tail and a carriage.
- Control the train with your arrow keys :arrow_up: :arrow_down: :arrow_left: :arrow_right: /WASD.
- If you are moving in a particular direction, then you can only change to a direction perpendicular to the current direction you’re going in.
- The train is in perpetual motion it cannot be stopped midway
- While moving you must pick up the people icons, to increase your score while simultaneously increasing the length by increasing the number of carriages
- If you hit a wall or a crash into yourself, the game will end. After the game end your score will be displayed for a few seconds before re-entering the loading screen.
